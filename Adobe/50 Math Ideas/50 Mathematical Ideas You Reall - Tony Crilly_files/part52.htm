The Babylonians based their number system on 60, while the modern base is 10 (decimal).</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><b>Binary number system </b>A number system based on <i>two </i>symbols, 0 and 1, fundamental for computer calculation.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><b>Cardinality </b>The number of objects in a set. The cardinality of the set {<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>} is 5, but cardinality can also be given meaning in the case of infinite sets.</p><h4 style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Chaos theory <span class="p">The theory of dynamical systems that appear random but have underlying regularity.</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><b>Commutative </b>Multiplication in algebra is commutative if <i>a </i>× <i>b </i>= <i>b </i>× <i>a</i>, as in ordinary arithmetic (e.g. 2 × 3 = 3 × 2). In many branches of modern algebra this is not the case (e.g. matrix algebra).</p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Conic section <span class="p">The collective name for the classical family of curves which includes circles, straight lines, ellipses, parabolas and hyperbolas.

Traditionally denoted by <i>ê</i>, it is a useful concept in set theory.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><b>Exponent </b>A notation used in arithmetic. Multiplying a number by itself, 5 × 5 is written 5<span class="s20">2 </span>with the exponent 2. The expression 5 × 5 × 5 is written 5<span class="s20">3</span>, and so on. The notation may be extended: for example, the number 5<span class="s20">½ </span>means the square root of 5. Equivalent terms are power and index.</p><h4 style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Fraction <span class="p">A whole number divided by another, for example 3/7.</span></h4><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><b>Geometry </b>Dealing with the properties of lines, shapes, and spaces, the subject was formalized in Euclid’s <i>Elements </i>in the third century BC.

In 73, the place value of 7 means ‘7 tens’ and of 3 means ‘3 units’.</span></h4><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Polyhedron <span class="p">A solid shape with many faces.
